    <p>
        Where do sea otters live? Small sea otter populations inhabit kelp forests, bays and coastal waters near islands, reefs, and fjords in the North Pacific Ocean. 
        In British Columbia, they are found along the windswept west coast of Vancouver Island and the central coast, near Bella Bella.

    <p> What do sea otters eat? </p>
    <p>
       Sea otters eat a seafood smorgasbord: clams, mussels, chitons, snails, prawns, crabs, abalone, sea urchins, squid, sea star legs and in some areas, several species of fishes. 
        Sea otters use their sense of touch to find food; diving sea otters feel for food along the ocean floor with their sensitive front paws.
