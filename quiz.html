        Where do sea otters live? Small sea otter populations inhabit kelp forests, bays and coastal waters near islands, reefs, and fjords in the North Pacific Ocean. 
        In British Columbia, they are found along the windswept west coast of Vancouver Island and the central coast, near Bella Bella.
